/**
 * ONE figure a module computed for ONE department over ONE period.
 *
 * This is the whole vocabulary of the department KPI contract: a module bundle hands these back and
 * the surface holding the department renders them, so a new module adds plates to every performance
 * surface without a line of code here changing.
 *
 * The two rules the model canon puts on this value object:
 *
 *  1. **`null` is unknown, and unknown is not zero.** The patrol module's coverage query answers
 *     null when no track was recorded in the window — "we did not measure" and "we measured
 *     nothing" are different facts, and a performance page that prints 0% for the first is lying.
 *     Every surface renders an unknown as a dashed labelled slot.
 *  2. **A count moves in percent, a share moves in points.** 88 patrols against 79 is +11.4%;
 *     54% coverage against 61% is −7 pts, never −11.5%. The unit decides, so no caller has to.
