/**
 * Builds the {@see RosterOverview} the team page's KPI strip and attention pane
 * are drawn from.
 *
 * ONE PLACE, ASKED ONCE. Every widget on that surface wants some of the same
 * facts — the counts, who has not arrived, who holds nothing — and a page that
 * let each widget query for itself would issue the same COUNT five times and
 * could still show five numbers that disagreed, because a preset can turn any
 * of them off independently.
 *
 * A SERVICE RATHER THAN A REPOSITORY METHOD: the interesting part is not any
 * one query but the rules about which rows count, and those rules are the
 * page's rather than the table's. Deactivating somebody resolves their
 * never-signed-in nag; a Super Admin with no position holds everything rather
 * than nothing; a deactivated administrator administers nothing. None of those
 * is a fact about `team_user`.
