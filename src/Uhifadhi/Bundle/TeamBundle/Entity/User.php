/**
 * A staff account of the single authority that runs an uhifadhi installation. Single-org:
 * no STI, no party isolation. Two authorization axes — a {@see TeamRoleEnum} tier and, for
 * Staff, an assigned {@see Position} bundling granular permissions.
 *
 * THE TABLE IS `team_user`, not `user`. Every bundle prefixes its tables with its own
 * name, and identity is no exception: an installation's schema has to say which package owns
 * a table, and `user` is additionally a reserved word every installation would have
 * had to quote.
 *
 * ADDRESSED BY UUID. The sequential id is Doctrine's business; anything outside this bundle —
 * a URL, an API payload, another module's foreign key surface — uses the uuid.
 *
 * TWO USER INTERFACES, AND THEY ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. Symfony's answers "who is signed
 * in" — the firewall's business. `Uhifadhi\Contracts\Entity\UserInterface`, imported here
 * aliased because the short names collide, answers "who is this record about": it is the
 * stand-in every other module points its associations at, so that no module has to require this
 * bundle to keep a record with a name on it. THIS BUNDLE CLOSES THAT LOOP ITSELF —
 * {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\TeamBundle::prependExtension()} prepends
 *
 *     doctrine:
 *         orm:
 *             resolve_target_entities:
 *                 Uhifadhi\Contracts\Entity\UserInterface: Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\User
 *
 * so an installation writes nothing. It is prepended rather than merged, which
 * means an installation whose people are its OWN entity names that class in its
 * doctrine.yaml and overrules this without disabling anything.
 *
 * The contract asks seven questions and this class already answered all seven before it declared
 * them — which is the sign the surface was measured against real modules rather than invented.
 * Nothing here may narrow to suit it: widening the contract is a contracts release, and dropping
 * one of the seven is a breaking change for every module that reads it.
