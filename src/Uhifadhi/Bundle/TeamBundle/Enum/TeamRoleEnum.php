/**
 * A user's tier within the single authority that runs uhifadhi. There is no
 * "Owner" — nobody owns a national park — and there are THREE tiers, not four.
 *
 * TWO OF THEM STAND ABOVE THE MATRIX. Super Admin is what an installation is
 * bootstrapped with and the only tier that may sign in as somebody else; Admin
 * is the recovery escape hatch for when a position has been mis-composed and
 * somebody has to be able to fix it. Both hold every permission by tier
 * ({@see canManageContent()}), which is the whole of what a tier decides.
 *
 * EVERYBODY ELSE IS STAFF, including the people who run the place. A Staff
 * member holds exactly what their {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\Position} grants
 * and nothing else — and a Staff member with no position holds nothing at all,
 * which is a real state of the model rather than an unfinished one.
 *
 * THERE IS NO MANAGER TIER, and its absence is the model's sharpest line. A
 * tier names a system level; "manager" names a job, and a tier that named a job
 * would let somebody administer the team while holding no capability at all —
 * which makes the permission matrix decorative for half the people in it.
 * Administering the team is an ordinary catalogue permission — `team.manage`,
 * the team's own `directory.manage` grant — granted through a
 * position.
 *
 * So "a manager" is something an administrator COMPOSES: a position carrying
 * `team.manage` plus whatever else that job needs. The authority is visible in
 * the matrix, countable across the roster, and revocable in one click. None of
 * those three is true of a tier, and all three are why there is no tier for it.
 *
 * The cost is honest and worth stating: "who administers this installation" is
 * not answerable from the tier column alone, because a Staff member holding
 * `team.manage` can. Every screen that asks gates on
 * `is_granted('team.manage')`, never on a tier.
 *
 * Permission queries live here to keep the user entity thin.
