/**
 * THE TWO LETTERS THIS BUNDLE SENDS, and the one question every screen that
 * offers to send one has to ask first: is there anything to send them with.
 *
 * THE MAILER IS OPTIONAL AND THE NULL IS THE ANSWER. `symfony/mailer` is a
 * suggestion rather than a requirement, so an installation that never sends
 * mail does not carry it — and where the package is absent, or present but with
 * no transport configured, the service simply is not in the container and this
 * class is constructed with null. One check, {@see isConfigured()}, covers both,
 * which is right because from a screen's point of view they are the same fact.
 *
 * WHAT THE SCREENS DO WITH THAT ANSWER IS NOT SILENCE. Invite-by-email is
 * OFFERED AND REFUSED where there is no mailer — the form visible, the button
 * inert, the reason written on it — because hiding it would leave an
 * administrator hunting for a feature the product does have, and swallowing the
 * click would leave a colleague waiting for an email nobody sent. A silently
 * discarded reset is the worst failure either of these flows has.
 *
 * THE LETTERS ARE PLAIN TEXT. A module bundle that shipped an HTML email would
 * be shipping a second design system nobody theming this installation can
 * reach, and the whole content of both letters is one sentence and one link.
