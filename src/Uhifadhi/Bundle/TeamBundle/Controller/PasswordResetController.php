/**
 * THE SELF-SERVICE SCREENS — the three a stranger reaches with nobody to ask.
 *
 * THEY STAND ON THE DOCUMENT RUNG, exactly as the sign-in card does and for its
 * reason: there is no sidebar to navigate and no top bar to act from until
 * there is somebody to act as, and a nav rendered for an anonymous visitor
 * leaks what an installation contains to whoever loads its front door.
 *
 * THE ANSWER TO "FORGOT MY PASSWORD" IS NEUTRAL. The same sentence, in the same
 * words, whether or not that address has an account. An installation that
 * answered differently for a known and an unknown address would be an
 * installation whose front door tells a stranger who works here. There is no
 * state of that screen that says "no such user".
 *
 * A LINK IS GOOD FOR ONE HOUR AND WORKS ONCE, and using it SIGNS EVERY OTHER
 * SESSION OF THE ACCOUNT OUT. That last part is the point of a reset — anywhere
 * the account was still open, a handset left in a vehicle, a machine in an
 * office somebody has left — so it is confirmed on screen rather than done
 * quietly.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS HAND-ROLLED AND NOT symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle. That
 * bundle is the standard and it was the first thing considered. Three things
 * decided against it. The columns this flow writes — `passwordResetToken` and
 * `passwordResetRequestedAt` — SHIPPED IN THIS BUNDLE'S FIRST RELEASE and are
 * what every design annotation names; adopting the bundle would mean a second
 * table, a second lifetime, and two places an installation could read the state
 * of one reset. It does not invalidate other sessions, which is a ruled
 * requirement here and would have had to be bolted on regardless. And what is
 * left after those two is a token, an hour and a lookup — about forty lines,
 * below the line where a dependency pays for itself. The security-relevant part
 * is not the plumbing but the neutral answer and the single use, and both are
 * this bundle's own rules either way.
